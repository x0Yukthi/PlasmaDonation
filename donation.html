                <h1>Covid-19</h1>

                <p><br> COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered strain of coronavirus, a type of virus known to cause respiratory infections in humans. This new strain was unknown before December 2019, when an outbreak of a pneumonia of unidentified cause emerged in Wuhan, China.
                </p>
              <p><br>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</p>
              <p><br>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.<br>Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.</p>

            <h1>Covid-19 Treatment</h1>
            <p>Thereâ€™s currently no treatment specifically approved for COVID-19, and no cure for an infection, although treatments and vaccines are currently under study.Instead, treatment focuses on managing symptoms as the virus runs its course.Other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS are also treated by managing symptoms. In some cases, experimental treatments have been tested to see how effective they are.</p>
            <p>Therapies used for these illnesses include:<br></p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
              <li>antiviral or retroviral medications</li>
              <li>breathing support, such as mechanical ventilation</li>
              <li>steroids to reduce lung swelling</li>
              <li>blood plasma transfusions</li>

            <img src="https://static.urbantecno.com/2020/04/sangre-plasma.jpg" alt="plasma">
            <p>Convalescent plasma (kon-vuh-LES-unt PLAZ-muh) therapy uses blood from people who've recovered from an illness to help others recover.Blood donated by people who've recovered from COVID-19 has antibodies to the virus that causes it. The donated blood is processed to remove blood cells, leaving behind liquid (plasma) and antibodies. These can be given to people with COVID-19 to boost their ability to fight the virus.</p>
            <p>Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin have been used successfully to treat other respiratory viruses. These treatments (given by a drip or injection) are generally well-tolerated, but unwanted effects can occur.</p>
            <p>Blood has been used to treat many other conditions. It's usually very safe. The risk of getting COVID-19 from convalescent plasma hasn't been tested yet. But researchers believe that the risk is low because donors have fully recovered from the infection.</p>

             <h2>Eligibility to Donate Plasma</h2>
             <p>People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma, which may help save the lives of other patients. COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from recovered individuals if they are eligible to donate blood. Individuals must have had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a laboratory test and meet other donor qualifications. Individuals must have complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days prior to donation. A negative lab test for active COVID-19 disease is not necessary to qualify for donation.</p>
